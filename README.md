# Suni
An awesome, cute, multipurpose, and satirical bot for dev and moderation tools for Discord, making everything a better place

## Hello!

Meet **Suni**, your flexible and feature-packed Discord companion! Designed to bring a mix of charm and functionality to your server, Suni is here to make administration a breeze and interactions much more entertaining. Whether you're looking for robust moderation tools or quirky social features, Suni has you covered.

Originally developed in C# using DSharpPlus as a fun learning project (and to satisfy my desire to program something a bit close to C++), he quickly evolved to grow more and more.

## What He Can Do

**He** comes packed with features, including customizable commands and useful tools that allow you to interact with your server in new ways.

- the functions are summarized as:
- **Moderation**: manage actions using scripts (you can use the SuniApi with NikoSharp and Lua langs, to automate things for example)
- **Social**: u can mess ur friends, get married, or beg others for money (these things will probably have some nasty bugs lol)
- **Help tools**: You can run regex, calculate expressions, translate binary and morse codes, and more!

Stay tuned—Suni’s about to make your Discord server better!

**See you soon!**
